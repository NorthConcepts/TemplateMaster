# TemplateMaster
TemplateMaster is a Java library for creating template driven content.  It can be used to generate web pages, emails, and anything else that can be created based on a textual template.

It uses [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) underneath for the heavy lifting and comes with [RESTEasy](https://resteasy.github.io/) hooks if that's your favourite RESTful framework.

The code was originally developed as part of our blog titled ["How To Build Template Driven Java Websites with FreeMarker and RESTEasy"](https://blog.stackhunter.com/2014/01/21/build-template-driven-java-websites-freemarker-resteasy/).


Enjoy.
